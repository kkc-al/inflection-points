## Research Questions
  * What are the types of inflection points in software evolution?
      * X% increase in commits/month
      * X% decrease in commits/month
      * X% increase in unique authors/month
      * X% decrease in unique authors/month
      * X% increase in users
      * X% decrease in users
      * X% increase in truck factor
      * X% decrease in truck factor
      * X% increase in popularity
      * X% decrease in popularity
      * X% increase in activity (in terms of pull requests/forks) 
      * X% decrease in activity (in terms of pull requests/forks)
     
  * What are the causes of inflection points in software evolution?
      * Migration to GitHub: check commit messages
      * New releases: check for release tags near inflection point
      * Security events: check news or CVE database for important dates
      * Bot adoption: check commit messages
      * Users adopt fork or competing project: check forks, compare to other projects 
      * core team reorganization (e.g. a project lead leaving the project/ newcomers bringing in fresh ideas)
      * change in team culture e.g. from hostile to more inclusive (may be through sentiment analysis) or vice-versa
      

## Tasks

  * Determine criteria for sampling projects. 
      * At least N years of history.
      * Popularity (as measured by number of authors, stars, watchers, etc.)
      * Programming language (highest usage above 50% according to GH stats) is language X.
  * Collect sample of projects from WoC.
  * Create time series of commits/month or unique authors/month using WoC.


## Schedule

Checkpoints are scheduled at 10-11:30am EST.

  * *Checkpoint 2 (Weds, Nov 18):* Refine RQs. Have sample of projects. Determine how to create time series. Plan for next checkpoint.
  * *Checkpoint 3 (Fri, Nov 20):*
  * *Checkpoint 4 (Wed, Nov 25):*
  * *Checkpoint 5 (Wed, Dec 2):*
  * *Final presentations (Sat, Dec 5):* 10am-1pm EST
