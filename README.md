## Tasks

  * Collect a sample of projects with at least N years of git history.
  * Potential additional filters:
      * Popularity (as measured by ?)
      * Programming language (most widely used and >50% according to GH stats)
  * Can we compute commits/month or unique authors/month using WoC?

## Research Questions
  * Can we identify causes or types of inflection points in software evolution.
  * Can we identify projects that have moved to GitHub and analyze effect of move?
