## Team Members

  * James Walden

## Research Questions
  * What are the types of inflection points in software evolution?
      * X% increase in commits/month
      * X% decrease in commits/month
      * X% increase in unique authors/month
      * X% decrease in unique authors/month
  * What are the causes of inflection points in software evolution?
      * Migration to GitHub: check commit messages
      * New releases: check for release tags near inflection point
      * Security events: check news or CVE database for important dates
      * Bot adoption: check commit messages
      * Users adopt fork or competing project: check forks, compare to other projects 

## Tasks

  * Determine criteria for sampling projects. 
      * At least N years of history.
      * Popularity (as measured by ?)
      * Programming language (highest usage above 50% according to GH stats) is language X
  * Collect sample of projects
  * Create time series of commits/month or unique authors/month using WoC.


## Schedule

  * *Checkpoint 1 (Nov 15):* Present tasks and research questions. Complete WoC tutorial before or after checkpoint.
  * *Checkpoint 2 (Nov 18):* Have sample of projects to examine. Determine how to create time series.
