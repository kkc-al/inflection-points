## Team Members

  * Noah Burgin

  * James Walden

## Tasks

  * Collect a sample of projects with at least N years of git history.
  * Potential additional filters:
      * Popularity (as measured by ?)
      * Programming language (highest usage above 50% according to GH stats)
  * Can we create time series of commits/month or unique authors/month using WoC?

## Research Questions
  * What are the types of inflection points in software evolution?
      * X% increase in commits/month
      * X% decrease in commits/month
      * X% increase in unique authors/month
      * X% decrease in unique authors/month
  * What are the causes of inflection points in software evolution?
      * Migration to GitHub: check commit messages
      * New releases: check for release tags near inflection point
      * Security events: check news or CVE database for important dates
      * Bot adoption: check commit messages
      * Users adopt fork or competing project: check forks, compare to other projects
